# CrewAI Assistant â€“ Project Plans

## 1. Vision & Purpose

- **Personal AI assistant** that can interact with my computer, record daily activities, and be available for ongoing conversation.
- Should be able to transcribe and summarize YouTube videos, allowing me to ask questions about their content.
- The assistant is for personal use (single user) for now.
- Help manage daily tasks, schedules, and household activities with voice alerts.
- Track and plan workouts, providing guidance and progress monitoring.

## 2. Core & Dream Features

### Core Features (Short-term)
- Voice and text interaction, always running in the background.
- Record and log daily activities via conversation.
- YouTube video transcription and summarization.
- English and Finnish language support.
- Simple memory system for:
  - Remembering plans and tasks
  - Storing important information from conversations
  - Tracking daily activities and habits
  - Quick retrieval of past information
- Daily schedule management with voice alerts
- Basic task organization and reminders
- Workout tracking and planning

### Dream Features (Long-term)
- Integration with Google Docs and other productivity tools.
- Suggest life optimizations based on activity analysis.
- Smart glasses integration for on-the-go use.
- Personalized recommendations (what to watch, do, etc.).
- Analyze my life and suggest improvements.
- Smart home integration for household management
- Automatic schedule optimization based on habits
- AI-powered workout optimization and form analysis

## 3. Integrations & Extensibility

- Planned: Google Cloud, Google Docs, YouTube API.
- Future: Add more tools as needs arise.
- Modularity: Rely on CrewAI for agent/tool modularity.

## 4. User Experience

- CLI-based for now, always-on background process.
- Future: Web interface for visualizations (e.g., graphs).
- Multilingual: English and Finnish.
- Voice alerts for important tasks and schedules.
- Voice guidance during workouts.

## 5. Technical Considerations

- **Data Storage:** Start with local vector storage; consider SQL for larger datasets.
- **Performance:** Fast response for direct conversation; agent tasks can be slower.
- **Parallelism:** Explore running agents in parallel while maintaining real-time chat.
- **Privacy:** Since it's personal, focus on local storage and privacy.

## 6. Memory System

### Basic Memory Features
- [ ] Simple key-value storage for quick facts and information
- [ ] Conversation history with timestamps
- [ ] Task and plan storage
- [ ] Daily activity logging
- [ ] Quick search and retrieval of stored information

### Memory Commands
- [ ] "Remember that..." - Store information
- [ ] "What did I say about..." - Retrieve information
- [ ] "Show me my plans for..." - View stored plans
- [ ] "What did I do yesterday..." - View activity history

### Implementation Notes
- Start with simple JSON/CSV storage
- Consider using SQLite for structured data
- Implement basic vector search for semantic retrieval
- Add timestamps to all entries
- Include metadata (context, importance, category)

### Memory System (Recent and Planned)
- [x] All conversations are logged per session in `conversation_history.txt`.
- [x] User can ask the agent (in agent mode) to review conversation history and extract important facts to memory (memories.txt) or ideas (ideas.txt).
- [x] System message instructs the assistant to respond naturally to memory requests in direct chat mode (e.g., "Sure, I'll remember that!").
- [ ] (Planned) Ability to mark "remember this" messages for easier extraction by the agent later.
- [ ] (Planned) Automatic memory extraction process that reviews conversation history at the end of the day and updates memories/ideas.

### Workout and Structured Data Logging
- [x] Free-form workout notes can be logged to `memories.txt`.
- [ ] (Planned) Separate file (e.g., `workouts.txt` or `workouts.json`) for structured workout data and analytics.

### Text-to-Speech (TTS)
- [x] Google Cloud TTS support with voice selection directly from the app.
- [x] Ability to test and preview different voices with a sample sentence.
- [ ] (Planned) Option to use other TTS services (e.g., Coqui TTS) easily.

### User Experience & File Management
- [x] `.gitignore` updated to exclude knowledge directory files and private files.
- [x] `conversation_history.txt` only logs the current session's messages.
- [x] All file paths are now absolute and based on the script location, so files are always created in the correct place.
- [ ] (Planned) Ability to filter and display only certain types of memories (e.g., only workouts, only ideas).

### Agent & Direct Mode
- [x] User can switch between agent mode (CrewAI) and direct mode (OpenAI API).
- [x] In agent mode, the model can use the memory tool and extract information from history.
- [x] In direct mode, memory requests are handled via system message for a natural experience.

### General & Future Ideas
- [ ] (Planned) User profile file for persistent user data (e.g., name, goals, preferences).
- [ ] (Planned) Automatic daily/periodic summary generation (e.g., "daily notes").
- [ ] (Planned) Agent can proactively ask the user if certain information should be remembered based on conversation context.
